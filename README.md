# Feedback Fruits' Tic-Tac-Toe Challenge

This repository houses the Ember frontend portion of the Feedback Fruits Tic-Tac-Toe coding challenge. You can find the Rails backend [here](https://github.com/Sensanaty/fbf-xoxo-backend).

## App Description

This is a simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe with the frontend built in EmberJS, featuring a local scoreboard stored via LocalStorage. The backend is built in Rails, and (hopefully) offers multiplayer functionality by utilizing Action Cable and Websockets as well as a global scoreboard via a simple PostgreSQL database.

### Why the weird repo name?

To break it down:

- `fbf` - Feedback Fruits
- `xoxo` - In Serbian, Tic-Tac-Toe is called 'Iks-Oks'
- `frontend` - I think this one is self explanatory
